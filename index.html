    <p>in ssms, when using t-sql to manipulate records, use "begin transaction" plus "rollback" before "commit".<br>
    e.g. <br>
    begin transaction <br>
    delete from tablename where id > 100<br>
    rollback<br>
    and ssms will tell you how many rows are affected.<br>
    if you feel that's correct, change rollback to commit, and execute<br>
    p.s. this solution may not be exactly correct, it works for me so far, I did not study into the implications yet.
