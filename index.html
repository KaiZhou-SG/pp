    <h3>1 use transaction</h3>
    <p>in ssms, when using t-sql to manipulate records, use "begin transaction" plus "rollback" before "commit".<br/>
    e.g. <br/>
    begin transaction <br/>
    delete from tablename where id > 100<br/>
    rollback<br/>
    and ssms will tell you how many rows are affected.<br/>
    if you feel that's correct, change rollback to commit, and execute<br/>
    p.s. this solution may not be exactly correct, it works for me so far, I did not study into the implications yet.

   <h3>1 clone a database</h3>
   <p>make a clone of a database within the same sql server instance:<br/>
   <ol>
    <li>in the sql server instance, create an empty new database, name it as originame_clone</li>
    <li>back up the database I want to clone, note the path backup file is kept, name it as origin_bk_path</li>
    <li>right click the database: originame_clone, go to tasks --> restore</li>
    <li>set device to origin_bk_path</li>
    <li>under select a page, choose: File</li>
    <li>the origin file path and destination file path are set by default, change the path of the destination file to what you want</li>
    <li>apply</li>
   </ol>
   </p>
   <p>there is also a case whereby I want to clone a database from one sql server instance to another, or even from one sql server to another sql server.<br/>
   That is not discussed here, for quick reference, it's said by MSDN that I can do that via "Copy Database" option via right click a database --> Tasks --> Copy database

   <h3>fix the width of my web pages</h3>
   <p>it's a good practice to make sure the text doesn't trancate when
   fold the web page to the side of the screen. howerver, it's very
   annoying to write a lot of br tags to change-line manually. Now
   here is the elegant solution:<br/>
   <ol>
    <li>enclosing the whole web page body in a div</li>
    <li>set the width attribute of that div to 700px</li>
    code examples:<br/>
    div.content {width: 700px}<br/>
    &lt;body&gt;<br/>
     &lt; div class="content"&gt;<br/>
     ...<br/>
     &lt;/div&gt;<br/>
    &lt;/body&gt;<br/>
   </ol>
   </p>
   <h2>2015-04-07</h2>
   <h3>git remote show origin</h3>
   <p>show remote information, such as origin. This command will list remote information,
   such as where is this work copy pulled from, where is it pushed to, and so on...</p>
   <h3>npm</h3>
   <p>As this html document gets longer and longer, I wanted an Http Server, to
   dynamically generate it for me, instead of hand-writting. Then I found this
   npm package.<br/>As far as I know, it's a package management program for nodejs
   package management. It 
   <ol>
    <li>provides an Http-Server application, I can use it to set up an Http Server, and it then listens to Http requests.</li>
    <li>helps to manage the nodejs packages</li>
    <li>provide a cli to operate the Http-Server</li>
   </ol> 
  </p>
  <p>bad news: npm is acqusited by godaddy, and does not allow new user sign up now.
  So I turn to node.js and the express web framework.</p>
